# Your life is currency

## Your

* Possesive form of you   
* Single entity of humanity (yourself)
* People or group  

## Life

Obvious:  
* HP Bar

Our life is a manifestation of :
* Body
* Mind
* Soul

Life is also :
* **The time between birth and death**
* Any being existing in a limited time span 

## Currency 

Obvious: 
* Money 
* Cash 

Currency is a **medium of exchange**  
Usually has a **measure value** and a **unit**

## Summing it up 

Your life is currency = use your own lifespan (measured, and has a unit) as a medium of exchange to get other advantages

Advantages : 
* Stuff (armor/swords) = better stats ?
* More life capacity 
* Advancing in the game
* Allies ?

# Game Ideas

## Rogue-like

* Buy stuff in randomly-placed shops (with your life - HP bar)
* Life stealing on your ennemies (take their *vital energy* .. idk)
* Picking up power-ups ?
* Turn-based ? ( -> boring / difficult to understand / low skillcap) = bad idea 
* Goal ?  

Implies : 
* Algorithm for proc gen ~5h  
* Stat system ~3h
* Stuffing system ~3h 
* Player movement / Ennemy IA ~4h
* Collisions ~4h
* Art (music / drawing) ~ 5h
* Way too much work!

## Puzzle

* Play a robot
* Battery = life, each turn uses some battery
* "Turn based"
* Trade item for "life" (turns) => Determine what stuff is ideal to get through the level 
* Get to the end of each level - you can get items at the end of each level 
    * New rotors (+1 movement)
    * Galvanized Armor (+1 shield)
    * Extended battery life (+1 life) 
    * Hacking system (gameplay element, disables an electric barrier)
    * "Mind transfer" => choose another robot to transfer your mind to (gameplay element)
    * "Portal gun"  
    * Teleporter (allows to teleport to a pod)

## Hybrid arcade / puzzle

Family simulation *Ã  la* Sims / Rogue Legacy (w/o action)
* You reincarnate as your heir : Limit = 
  * fixed number of generations ? 
  * average lifespan getting lower and lower, if you dont have time to reproduce, your family dies
* You make someone get through their life(span), the more successful in life they are, the higher your (added) score. Choices each turn (~3 years) =  
    * Study 
    * Have fun 
    * Art: drawing
    * Art: music
